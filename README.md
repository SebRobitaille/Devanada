31 Jul - SR:
I like the fonts, the logo and the colors. We can start with these and adjust as it comes together if needed. If you liked the style of my portfolio page we can start with something like that? It's plain JS with some SCSS but I'm sure we can make it with regular CSS. We can also upgrade to a React website as our knowledge develops.

Changes made:
-Added links to fonts, added fonts to CSS sheet.
-Moved Script tag to head section of HTML, add defer in the tag to make it pseudo at the end (but it's still "hoisted").
-Layed out some boilerplate HTML for the pseudo-single page application look.
 -> Added 5 sections (can be changed to fit however many "pages" we want)
 -> will add buttons to swtich between sections tomrrow
